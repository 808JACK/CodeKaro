# Contest Code Execution Implementation

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes (pair-program-hub-main)

1. **Removed Template System**
   - Users now start with empty code editor (`# Write your solution here\n`)
   - No more pre-filled function templates
   - Users write complete solutions from scratch

2. **Added Code Execution API Integration**
   - Added `RUN_CODE` and `SUBMIT_CODE` endpoints to API config
   - Created `CodeExecutionRequest` and `CodeExecutionResponse` interfaces
   - Implemented `runCode()` and `submitCode()` methods in ContestService

3. **Enhanced Test Case Display**
   - Added visual indicators: ✓ (passed), ✗ (failed), ⟳ (running)
   - Shows execution time for each test case
   - Displays verdict badges (AC, WA, TLE, MLE, CE, RE)
   - Shows actual output vs expected output comparison
   - Displays error messages for failed test cases

4. **Improved User Experience**
   - Loading states for Run and Submit buttons
   - Disabled buttons during execution
   - Toast notifications for execution results
   - Real-time test case status updates

### Backend Integration

The backend already supports:
- Docker-based code execution
- Multiple verdict types (AC, WA, TLE, MLE, CE, RE)
- Test case parsing from MinIO storage
- Error handling and timeout management

### Test Case Format

Test cases are stored in MinIO with format:
```
nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 → output: [0,1]
head_arr = [4,5,1,9], node_val = 5 → output: [4,1,9]
```

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/contests/code/run` - Run code against sample test cases
- `POST /api/contests/code/submit` - Submit code against all test cases

### Request Format

```json
{
  "code": "def two_sum(nums, target):\n    # user code here",
  "language": "python",
  "problemName": "1",
  "timeLimitMs": 2000,
  "memoryLimitMb": 256
}
```

### Response Format

```json
{
  "overallVerdict": "AC",
  "testResults": [
    {
      "testNumber": 1,
      "verdict": "AC",
      "timeMs": 45,
      "output": "[0, 1]",
      "error": ""
    }
  ],
  "error": null
}
```

## How It Works

1. User joins/creates contest room
2. User writes code from scratch (no template)
3. User clicks "Run" to test against sample cases
4. System sends code to collab service
5. Code executes in Docker container
6. Results displayed with visual indicators
7. User can submit for full test suite

## Error Types Supported

- **AC** - Accepted
- **WA** - Wrong Answer
- **TLE** - Time Limit Exceeded
- **MLE** - Memory Limit Exceeded
- **CE** - Compilation Error
- **RE** - Runtime Error
